# Euler-Solver
Euler Solver for numerical approximation of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)

Insert both m files in one directory, use ODE m file for seting up the problem.
- ODE1: Solver File
- ODE: Main script where you can define the ODE and call ODE1 solver to yield the numerical approximation.
